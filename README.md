# PhotoBooth 

In the continuity of [Immich](https://immich.app), and [Google Photo links](https://photos.google.com/),
PhotoBooth hopes to create a familiar experience for photos that are expected to be published on Events'
website. It is supposed to be an alternative to existing applications such as [Piwigo](https://piwigo.org/),
but without a dedicated CMS.

## Features

***TODO***

## Building & Deploying

It is a bit early to deploy this app in production, and the building steps
are evolving quickly. That said, it is based on standard dependencies for such
web applications.

PhotoBooth makes use of [NPM](https://npmjs.com), [AstroJS](https://astro.build) and [SolidJS](https://www.solidjs.com/).

* Install the dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

* Run the dev server

```bash
npm run dev
```

* Build the app (and its content) for deployment

```bash
npm run build
```
